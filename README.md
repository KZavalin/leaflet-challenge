# leaflet-challenge
 Dear graders,

 Please find all relevant code in the "Leaflet-Part-1" directory. Just run the index.html, the visualization should work in your browser. 
 "Starter Code" directory contains unedited code. "Leaflet-Part-2" directory is bonus and is blank as of this writing, as I am focusing on the 
 project 3 assignment.

 Best,
 Kirill
